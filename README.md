# Food Truck Project

### Project Description ###
This project simulates a user rating the quality of food trucks on a scale
of 1-10. After the user has rated a number of food trucks, the user selects
from a menu of options: See highest rated truck, see average rating of all
trucks and more.

### Project Purpose ###
To practice implementing static fields, creating custom classes,
encapsulating data by using private fields with getters and setters and
practice implementing more complex methods with conditionals and loops.


### Points of Interest ###
Using static fields to keep track of data.
Using private fields in combination with getter and setter methods to
protect data from being accessed unintentionally.
Passing references of objects with methods to access data.
